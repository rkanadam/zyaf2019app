          <h3 class="subheading mb-3">Time</h3>
          <p>
            Time is the embodiment of God. Thus, we should work towards spending our time in a useful
            manner. It should be respected because everything in this creation is dependent on time.
            Breaking down a day, there are 86,400 seconds available to us. Why waste it when we can spend it
            on something effective?

            Let’s use our physical, mental, and spiritual energies to uplift ourselves and the community.
            The path of Divinity is not seeing, listening, speaking, thinking, or doing anything bad. Let’s
            conserve our energy in these five areas, and make our lives more meaningful by living up to our
            potential.
